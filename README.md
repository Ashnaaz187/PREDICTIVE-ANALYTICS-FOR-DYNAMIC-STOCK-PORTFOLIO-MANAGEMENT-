📊 PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS FOR DYNAMIC STOCK PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
🧠 Overview:

The stock market is a highly dynamic and volatile ecosystem influenced by financial, political, and social factors. Traditional analytical methods often fail to interpret market volatility due to its non-linear and unpredictable nature, leading to unreliable forecasts and poor investment decisions.

To overcome these challenges, this project introduces an AI-based Stock Market Consulting and Prediction System deployed on the web to forecast short-term price movements, analyze market tendencies, and support data-driven portfolio management.

🚀 Key Features

📈 Short-Term Forecasting: Predicts 3-day, 5-day, and 10-day stock price trends using machine learning models trained on historical data.

🤖 AI-Driven Decision Support: Assists investors in making data-backed investment decisions and timing trades effectively.

📊 Portfolio Analysis & Optimization: Evaluates and manages stock portfolios dynamically with risk insights and asset performance tracking.

📁 Downloadable Investment Reports: Generates automated summaries and portfolio analysis reports for practical use.

🌐 Web Accessibility: Hosted online for real-time data visualization and predictive analytics.
